Team Name: Destination Do-gooders
Website Name/Project Title: Volunteer Here!

Description
A website that offers a few feature destinations in the U.S. to travel to where you can volunteer as part of your travel experience. 
Travel destinations will be placed into an array. The website will utilize the Google Flights API to show 
available flights on the days users will want to travel. We will utilize the Volunteer Match API to get that data. 
And, if time, we will use the Away from Home API and/or AirBnB API to find lodging possibilities in the area. 
The website will offer a login and storing information on a firebase noSQL server to retrieve information for saved 
trip information.

Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
Develop a one page app/website that has a panel for searching for available flights to a desired destination 
for a certain number of volunteers utilizing Google Flights.
HTML panel with available flights in the date range once entered.
(If time) an HTML panel with lodging possibilities utilizing Away from Home and/or AirBnB.
Feature destinations will be presented in a carousel of panels at the bottom of the page. 
This will be a new feature we have not utilized before in a project.
